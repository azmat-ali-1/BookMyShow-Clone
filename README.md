# BookMyShow-Clone

I would describe this project as a web development project that involved creating a clone of 
the BookMyShow website using HTML and CSS. The goal of the project was to practice and improve 
skills in front-end web development, including website structuring, content creation, and styling.

To achieve this goal, the project followed a structured development process, which included:

1) Planning and analysis: This involved analyzing the original BookMyShow website to identify
its key features and functionality, as well as creating a plan for recreating these features using HTML and CSS.

2)Design and development: This involved using HTML and CSS to create a layout that
closely resembled the original BookMyShow website. The project also included the creation of different 
design elements using CSS, including fonts, colors, and borders.


Deployment: Finally, the project was deployed to a live server, making it accessible to the public.

Throughout the project, the software engineer had to use various tools and technologies, including HTML, CSS, and Git, to 
manage and track changes to the code.
